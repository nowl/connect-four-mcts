# TUI Connect-Four with Monte Carlo Tree Search AI

![example play](https://i.imgur.com/KvGpyHU.gif)

This is a more extended example of using the [yamcts](https://crates.io/crates/yamcts) Monte Carlo Tree Seach (MCTS)
library for building a MCTS AI into a game.

I was also using this as a opportunity to learn [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/) to develop a text-based user interface
around the game of [Connect Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four).

## Usage

``` bash
cargo run --release
```
